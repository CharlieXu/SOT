v0.1 Experimental release

v0.2
  - The Surrogate and Sampling are now inputs to the optimization algorithm
  - Many major changes in the code structure

v0.3
  - General code cleanup
  - Added README.md
  - Changed the installation directory of SOT

v0.4
  - Cleaned up member names and all members are now protected/private
  - Added a DDS test
  - Improved error handling

v0.5
  - SOT uses seed 0 by default for reproducibility
  - The seed can be set as random or the user can specify a given seed
  - Minor bugfixes

v0.6
  - Improved documentation
  - Doxygen source documentation is here: https://codedocs.xyz/dme65/SOT/

v0.7
  - The surrogate optimization strategy supports evaluations in synchronous parallel
  - Changed the CMake setup so that SOT builds on Windows with Cygwin
  - Added a test for synchronous parallel

v0.8
    - Made it possible to supply the distances to the interpolation nodes when evaluating the surrogate

v0.9
  - Added a Genetic Algorithm to minimize on the surrogate
  - All optimization algorithms now support synchronous parallel
  - Added a Travis CI build test

v0.10
  - Added more tests and improved code coverage to 98%
  - Fixed a bug in the GA in case all function values are inf, in which case a random tournament winner is selected
  - Taking care of the Pthread dependency correctly
  - CMake builds with Release mode if no build is specified
  - Fixed a bug in the ConstantTail and in the Capped RBF
  - Fixed a bug for the GA Sampling when running in parallel
